# Skyseed

A **terraforming skyblock** mod for **Minecraft 1.21.1 / NeoForge**. Craft a *Skyseed*, throw it into open air, and ~2 seconds later a procedurally generated, themed sky island germinates where it comes to rest. Progression is driven by **exploration + crafting**, not block-condensing.

> This README is the consolidated project plan (architecture, data model, decisions, status). For the island-by-island *content* roadmap — every planned island type, its blocks, variants, and recipes — see **[SKYISLANDSPLAN.md](SKYISLANDSPLAN.md)**.

## Concept

You start on a small, hand-authored sky island. Crafting produces a **Skyseed**, a throwable item. Thrown into the void, it arms briefly, then *germinates*: particles, a sound, and a new island grows in over the next ticks. The loop:

> craft a Skyseed → throw it → a new themed island appears → harvest new resources → craft the next, pricier Skyseed.

Different recipes produce Skyseeds of different **themes** (forest, rocky, …) and sizes. Exploration *and* crafting are both progression currency.

### Design pillars

1. **Themed, never identical.** Every island is rolled within its theme — irregular silhouette, varied decoration, clustered ores. No pasted blobs.
2. **Curated start, procedural everything-after.** The first island is authored block-by-block so a player can never soft-lock on turn one. Everything after is generated.
3. **Adding content is data, not code.** A new theme, recipe, ore, or biome flavor is JSON. Zero Java changes to extend the game.

## Status

**All planned engine milestones (0–9) are complete**, plus several post-plan features. What exists today:

| Area | Built |
|---|---|
| Core loop | Throwable charge-to-launch seed → arm timer → germinate → tick-budgeted grow-in |
| Themes (seeds) | All 11 planned island types: **Forest**, **Large Forest**, **Rocky**, **Desert**, **Mushroom**, **Frozen**, **Meadow**, **Badlands**, **Ancient**, **Lush**, **Aquatic** (`skyseed:*`) |
| Banded fill | `fill_bands` palette option: a Y-cycled body palette for badlands-style strata |
| Underside decor | per-variant `underside` list: hanging dripstone, cave vines, spore blossoms, roots from the island's bottom |
| Two-tall plants | ground entries that are double plants (dripleaves, pitcher plant, tall flowers) place both halves |
| Hand-built trees | `skyseed:mangrove`, `skyseed:azalea` — trees whose vanilla features won't place on floating islands |
| Pond water plants | `pond.plants` list: lily pads on the surface, kelp / seagrass / coral / sea pickle / wet sponge on the floor |
| Throw modes | Classic (charged physics arc) + Precise (direct placement along the look vector); toggle keybind (default **V**), persisted in client config |
| Datapack themes | Full `IslandTheme` codec (the keystone); themes are pure JSON |
| Biome response | `biome_overrides` keyed to the germination biome (Forest rolls acacia over savanna, jungle over jungle, lake over ocean, …) |
| Y-band overrides | `min_y` / `max_y` gating — drives Rocky's deepslate ↔ coal/iron gradient and snow peaks |
| Water | Contained ponds; off-rim static waterfall cascades; hand-built mangroves (`skyseed:mangrove`) |
| Surface | Per-column `surface_scatter` (block mixes); snow-capped peaks (taller shape + snow) |
| World | Void world preset with multi-noise overworld biomes; structures disabled |
| Start | Curated start island; safe spawn (valid biome, on island not in a tree); first-join guide book |
| Guide | Patchouli book (Forest / Rocky / Large Forest entries, advancement-gated to "crafted it once") |
| Safety | Tick-budget placement (no single-tick stalls); overlap nudge + fizzle-and-drop |

**All 11 island types in [SKYISLANDSPLAN.md](SKYISLANDSPLAN.md) are now built.** Remaining polish is small and mostly placement-shaped: water-edge sugar cane, side vines, sculk veins, Frozen ice spikes, and bees inside Meadow nests (needs entity spawning). Content beyond the island set lives in the sibling plans `SKYANIMALSPLAN.md` (mobs) and `THROWMODEPLAN.md` (throw modes). Nether/End skyblock dimensions are a long-term goal.

## The Skyseed item

**One item, `skyseed:island_seed`.** It is *not* one item per theme — every Skyseed is the same item carrying a different `skyseed:theme` data component (a `ResourceLocation`), set by the recipe that crafted it. A `minecraft:item_name` component gives each its display name ("Forest Skyseed"). An optional `minecraft:custom_model_data` int selects a distinct per-theme icon via a client model (e.g. Rocky); without it the default Skyseed model is used.

- **Throwing.** Hold right-click to wind up, release to throw. Two modes, toggled by a keybind (default **V**, persisted in client config — see `THROWMODEPLAN.md`): **Classic** lobs a charged physics arc (a tap lands close, a full ~1.25 s charge flies far) and germinates where it lands; **Precise** places the island directly along the look vector at a charge-scaled distance (5–40 blocks) and germinates exactly there. On release the client sends a packet; the server validates and spawns the seed. Throw height/distance are how the player *chooses* an island's germination Y (and thus, on Rocky, its ore band).
- Recipe *inputs* can't match on item components, so a Skyseed can't be crafted from another Skyseed; crafting from ordinary/modded items is unaffected.

This is what makes the data-driven model possible: a new Skyseed is one recipe JSON pointing at one theme JSON. No new item, no Java.

## Configuration

The dividing line: **config owns the *what & how much*** (recipes, palettes, ore tables, variants, shape, overrides); **code owns the *how*** (the generation algorithm).

### Recipe (data)

A normal datapack shaped-crafting recipe whose `result` is the seed item plus components. The Forest seed — planks + dirt checkerboard:

```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:crafting_shaped",
  "pattern": ["PD", "DP"],
  "key": { "P": { "item": "minecraft:oak_planks" }, "D": { "item": "minecraft:dirt" } },
  "result": {
    "id": "skyseed:island_seed",
    "components": {
      "skyseed:theme": "skyseed:forest",
      "minecraft:item_name": "\"Forest Skyseed\""
    }
  }
}
```

> **Gotcha:** `item_name` in a recipe result uses the legacy string-component serializer — the value must be a **JSON-escaped string** (`"\"Forest Skyseed\""`), not a bare string.

### Theme (data)

One JSON per theme under `data/<namespace>/skyseed/theme/<id>.json` (the `skyseed:theme` datapack registry). Block/feature ids resolve at gen time; a **missing id is skipped with a warning**, so a theme can optionally reference modded content and still load cleanly without that mod.

**Top-level keys**

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shape` | Shape | — (required) | Silhouette + vertical profile |
| `palette` | Palette | — (required) | The layered blocks |
| `ores` | OreEntry[] | `[]` | Base ore table |
| `variants` | Variant[] | `[]` | Weighted decoration looks (one rolled per island) |
| `biome_overrides` | BiomeOverride[] | `[]` | Conditional tweaks by biome and/or Y |
| `pond` | Pond | — | Optional contained pool |

**Shape** — `radius` `{min,max}` (required) · `rim_noise` float (0.40) · `underside` (`teardrop`) · `top_dome` `{min,max}` (`{1,2}`; raise for peaks).

**Palette** — `surface`, `fill`, `core` block ids (required) · `fill_depth` int (3) · `surface_scatter` GroundEntry[] (`[]`, mixes blocks into the surface per column) · `fill_bands` block-id[] (`[]`; when set, the body (fill + core) becomes a Y-cycled list of strata — badlands cliffs; core still seeds ores) · `band_thickness` int (2; blocks per band).

**OreEntry** — `block` (required) · `chance` float presence-roll (required) · `count` `{min,max}` veins (required) · `vein_size` `{min,max}` (required) · `depth` (`core` | `deep_core`; deep = lower ~40% of the core).

**Variant** — `weight` int (1) · `name` string · `surface_override` block id · `decoration` { `trees`: TreeEntry[], `ground`: GroundEntry[], `underside`: GroundEntry[] }. `underside` entries hang from each column's bottom face — `pointed_dripstone` and `cave_vines` build multi-block strands; others (spore blossom, hanging roots, …) hang one block. A `ground` entry that resolves to a two-tall plant (dripleaf, pitcher plant, tall flower) places both halves.

**TreeEntry** — `feature` id (required; a vanilla configured feature, or a built-in hand-built tree: **`skyseed:mangrove`**, **`skyseed:azalea`**) · `tries` int (3) · `spacing` int (3).

**GroundEntry** — `block` id (required) · `chance` float per-column (required).

**Pond** — `block` fluid id (`minecraft:water`) · `radius` int (3) · `depth` int (2) · `plants` GroundEntry[] (`[]`; per-column water plants — `lily_pad` floats on the surface, `kelp` fills a column, `tall_seagrass` places both halves, and anything else roots on the floor, waterlogged if it can be). Walled by the domed rim and placed without block updates, so it stays still and never spills into the void.

### Biome overrides

Each entry in `biome_overrides` is conditionally applied on top of the base theme. It **matches** when *both* its biome list and its Y range pass (first match wins); each present field then **replaces** the base theme's field for that island.

| Field | Type | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `biomes` | string[] | Biome ids or `#tags`; **empty = any biome** |
| `min_y` / `max_y` | int | Germination-Y gate (each optional) |
| `surface` / `fill` / `core` | block id | Palette overrides |
| `fill_depth` | int | Palette override |
| `surface_scatter` | GroundEntry[] | Surface mix override |
| `shape` | Shape | Silhouette override (e.g. taller snow peaks) |
| `ores` | OreEntry[] | Ore-table override |
| `variants` | Variant[] | Decoration override (`[]` = bare) |
| `pond` | Pond | Add/override a pond |
| `waterfalls` | int | Number of static cascades off the rim |

Examples in the shipped themes: Forest over `#minecraft:is_ocean` → lake island + pond + waterfalls; over `mangrove_swamp` → mud + hand-built mangroves; Rocky with `max_y: 8` → deepslate island with diamonds; Rocky with `min_y: 130` *or* a snowy biome → snow-capped peak.

## Generation algorithm

A near-pure function `planIsland(ServerLevel, BlockPos center, IslandTheme, Holder<Biome>, RandomSource) → IslandPlan`, then a scheduler applies the plan over several ticks.

1. **Match** the first applicable `biome_override` (biome + germination Y), producing the effective shape/palette/ores/variants/pond/waterfalls.
2. **Silhouette.** A 2D rim-radius **noise field** (never a clean sphere) extruded with a **teardrop** profile — flat-ish domed top, tapering underside.
3. **Layered fill.** surface → fill band (`fill_depth`) → core, with jitter.
4. **Ores.** Per entry: roll `chance`, then place `count` clustered **veins** (random-walk of `vein_size`) within the core, weighted by `depth`.
5. **Pond / waterfalls / decoration.** Carve the pond; pick weighted variant; place trees (vanilla features queued, or `skyseed:mangrove` hand-built into the plan) and per-column ground cover; add rim cascades.
6. **RNG.** `RandomSource.create(worldSeed ^ center.asLong())` — unique per island, reproducible, decorrelated from neighbours.

**Two guards:** *tick-budget placement* drains ~512 blocks + 2 trees per tick (no stutter; doubles as a grow-in animation, using block flags that avoid cascading neighbour/light updates); *overlap safety* nudges germination up through `{0, 8, 16, 24}` and, if nothing is clear, fizzles and drops the seed back rather than carving into existing terrain.

## World & progression setup

- **World preset `skyseed:skyblock`** — a void `noise_settings` (final density 0, air blocks, `sea_level: -64` to dodge the hardcoded lava floor) with a **multi-noise overworld biome source**, so F3 shows real, varied biomes over empty sky. Selectable as a world type and defaulted on the create-world screen, with structure generation turned off.
- **Start island** — a curated build placed at world creation (guarded by a new-world check), with spawn forced onto a valid land biome and onto the island surface (not into a tree).
- **First join** — the player is teleported to the start island and given the Patchouli guide.

---

## Architecture

`dev.gemberkoekje.skyseed`:

- **`Skyseed`** — `@Mod` entry point; registers everything below. `MODID = "skyseed"`.
- **`registry/`** — `DeferredRegister`s for the item, throwable entity type, the `skyseed:theme` data component, creative tab; and `SkyseedRegistries` (the `skyseed:theme` datapack registry, via `DataPackRegistryEvent`).
- **`item/`** — `IslandSeedItem` (charge-to-throw) and `GuideItem` (opens the Patchouli book).
- **`entity/IslandSeedEntity`** — `ThrowableItemProjectile` carrying the theme; arms `ARM_DURATION = 40` ticks (~2 s), rests on block-hit, then `germinate()`s (overlap loop → enqueue plan).
- **`worldgen/`** — `IslandGenerator` (the algorithm) → `IslandPlan`; `GenerationJob` + `IslandGrowth` (the tick-budget scheduler on `ServerTickEvent.Post`); `StartIsland`; `SkyseedWorldData` (`SavedData`); `WorldSetupEvents`; `event/PlayerEvents`.
- **`worldgen/theme/`** — the codec records: `IslandTheme`, `Shape`, `Palette`, `OreEntry`, `Variant`, `Decoration`, `TreeEntry`, `GroundEntry`, `Pond`, `BiomeOverride`, plus `IntRange`, `OreDepth`, `Underside`.
- **`client/SkyseedClientEvents`** — renderers and the world-type default hook.

## Design decisions (resolved)

The plan's former open questions, settled by the build:

- **Naming.** "Skyseed" is the locked name for the mod and the thrown item; per-theme display names ("Forest Skyseed", …) come from the `item_name` component.
- **Germination point.** The seed germinates at its **rest position** after a fixed ~2 s arm (tuned down from the original 3 s) — wherever it stopped, or mid-air if still flying. Throw power therefore controls the island's Y.
- **Bridging.** v1 is **free-floating only**; the overlap nudge keeps islands from merging. Growing onto existing islands is deferred.
- **Theme codec.** Finalized and extended well past the original sketch (`biome_overrides`, `min_y`/`max_y`, `surface_scatter`, `pond`, `waterfalls`, `shape.top_dome`).
- **RNG seeding.** `worldSeed ^ center` only; the planned `throwCount` term was dropped as redundant — overlap safety already guarantees distinct centers.
- **Structure templates / jigsaw.** Remain deferred; pure procedural generation is sufficient.

**Still open:** multiplayer client-sync hasn't been explicitly verified (generation is server-side and placed with client-updating block flags, so it *should* be fine).

---

## Modpack roadmap

Loader is **NeoForge** because the intended pack is content-heavy (most non-Create tech mods worth a pack's identity live there, several NeoForge-exclusive). The Skyseed mechanic is the pack's signature, so it doesn't need Create.

- **Tech:** Immersive Engineering, Mekanism, Applied Energistics 2, Powah.
- **Quests:** FTB Quests + Library/Teams — each island theme is a natural quest gate (model the actual branching DAG, not a single column).
- **Beauty:** Supplementaries, Macaw's suite, Immersive Furniture, Chipped/Rechiseled.
- **Performance:** Sodium + modern stack.

*(Mod-availability landscape last checked June 2026; re-verify 1.21 support before locking the pack.)*

## Building & running

Requires **JDK 21** (NeoForge 1.21.1's required Java). The build is pinned to a local JDK 21 via `org.gradle.java.home` in `gradle.properties` — adjust that path if your JDK lives elsewhere.

```sh
./gradlew build          # compile + package the mod jar
./gradlew runClient      # launch a dev Minecraft client with the mod loaded
./gradlew runServer      # launch a dev dedicated server
```

The first invocation downloads Gradle, NeoForge, and Minecraft, so it takes a while.

## Repository layout

- `src/main/java/dev/gemberkoekje/skyseed/` — mod sources (`Skyseed.java` is the `@Mod` entry point).
- `src/main/resources/data/skyseed/skyseed/theme/` — the theme JSONs (`forest`, `forest_large`, `rocky`).
- `src/main/resources/` — assets, recipes, advancements, the Patchouli book, and the world preset.
- `src/main/templates/` — `META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml` source (Patchouli is a required dep).
- `gradle.properties` — mod id/version and Minecraft/NeoForge versions.
